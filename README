Welcome to RADiX Development
===========================

Directory Details:

deploy
   What we envision a radix deployment looking like once fully unwrapped. One
   should be able to put this on their machine and start up the RADiX 
   distribution.

source
   Capture what we believe the source layout should like. This will eventually
   drive development of our archetypes and a mapping to the deployment 
   structure.
